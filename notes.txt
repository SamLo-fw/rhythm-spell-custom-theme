- the fade-in on key notes appears to be 50% of the early/late time


100%-80% accuracy: YEAH!
>80%-65% accuracy: NICE!
>65%-50% accuracy: GOOD
>50%-25% accuracy: OK
>25%-0% accuracy: MID
0%: Miss

ex: 1 beat early late:

0-0.25 -> MID
0.25-0.5 -> OK

etc etc

and 1-1.2 -> YEAH!
1.2-1.35 -> NICE!
.. and so on.


- actions in the same grouping seem to be order-dependant. if I set an action to go to 100% opacity at beat 0 over 2 beats, and then 0% at beat 0 over 0 beats but AFTER the first action, it seems the second one plays.
basically the actions system only queues one transform at a time per type per action type?

if you miss, the 3 base sprites turn red and drop down over ~1 second. so the total exist time for a sprite: early/late time + 1 second


when a note is pressed, there's an outline that expands and fades as feedback. This is invariant compared to the BPM/early late time. 
~250ms seems to be a decent approximation.

key-touch is comprised of:

- the base, called QMode1
- a thin overlay, called QMode1 overline
- the text

the approach has
- QMode1 line, which is the triple layered approach circle. Set to about sizes of 1.0x, 1.04x, and 1.08x.
- the 1.0x sprite size stays on the actual sprite when the approach is done

when pressed, there's a pulse generated that fades out over ~205ms, which in-game seems to be the QMode1 line sprite but on paper can be something else

key-keep is comprised of:

- the base, QMode2
- for some reason the thin overlay sprite in the game files is wrong and needs to be scaled by 1.033x but it's called QMode2 overline
- and the text

- the approach is the same, but QMode line doesn't acutally appear on the object. Instead, it appears at a roughly 1.5x size, and shrinks from the timestamp
of the object until the late time ends. in terms of actions, the best comprimise is to have it render early, which does diverge from the game's native experience.
otherwise I can't communicate the action to a nonexistant object.


-issues: key-touch might still be fading in as it fades out when pressed, which measn that the fade-in ends after the fade out and causes some amoutn of opacity > 0.
	-resolution: delete the objects instead of hiding them

- you can also slide the notes over the course of the object as needed + the slide line.
	-let users upload a 32x32 sprite for the slide line?
	

key-hit is comprised of:
the same base+overline+text setup.
comprimise: Then, the actual underlying objects are n key-touch objects for each hit of the key-hit. The first extends over the whole length 
of the note. The rest last exactly as long as then to the next object.
Each hit creates the pulse, alongside the growing number. All the numbers actaully render beforehand, but they're all bound to different 
groups. they are deleted on press. 
Growing darken sprite.



key-touch:
- base, font, approach fade in over early time/2 on object creation
- if you hit the key, pulse grow and fade, base, font, overline grow and fade to zero and delete the object early when fade finishes (won't override fadein since in different category)
	- overline fades on its own
- overline appears at timestamp on top of sprite
- wait until late time passes, and fall downwards over 1 beat, and turn red (so early/late * 2 + 30), then delete if not already deleted
- timing window notes render when their hitwindow enters at zero opacity, on hit go to 100 opacity and grow, then delete

key-keep:
- base, font, approach fade in over early time/2 on object creation

key-hit: 
- base, font, approach fade in over early time/2 on object creation
